		<h3 class="carHeader">Porsche 918 spyder<h3>

		<p class="review">A hybrid hypercar like no other. Two electric motors and a 9,000rpm 4.6-litre racing V8 contained within a two-seat roadster frame that’s almost entirely carbon fibre. Four wheel-drive, 875bhp and an even more incredible 944lb ft of torque, with over half of that available at only 800rpm. Yes, you did read that right. There really is nothing else like the 918 Spyder.

		<h4 class="preformance" >Preformance<h4>

		<p class="preformanceRev">Not even the McLaren P1 and LaFerrari, the other two members of the ‘Holy Trinity’. The plug-in Porsche, with a 6.8kWh battery twice the size of the McLaren’s, 282bhp of e-thrust alone and an electric range of 12 miles is easily the most hybrid of the three. It’s capable of hitting 62mph in a little more than six seconds on electric alone.</p>

		<h3 class="carHeader">Ferrari LaFerrari<h3>

		<p class="review">drives like the best Ferrari ever made. Which in terms of useable horsepower, it is. Only 499 have been built, available only to serious Ferrari collectors, and they’re all sold out. A car so fantastic the company decided to make it definitive (it is literally called The Ferrari), neatly annexing the Italian company in a weird little semantic cul-de-sac when it comes to naming its next car…</p>

		<h4 class="preformance" >Preformance<h4>

		<p class="preformanceRev">Ferrari states that the car has a top speed of 352 km/h (218 mph). In terms of acceleration, it can go 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.6 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in under 6.9 seconds, and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 15 seconds were announced by Ferrari.</p>

		<h3 class="carHeader">Mclaren P1<h3>

		<p class="review">Built exclusively for track use, the P1 is possibly even more remarkable. The P1's industrial-sounding engine feels even more alive, straight-line performance destroys GT3-class racers, yet the road car's balance and agility remain, despite wearing a set of slicks. It's fairly handy around Anglesey, too...</p>

		<h4 class="preformance" >Preformance<h4>

		<p class="preformanceRev">One word: savage. In a straight-line, the P1 is the fastest of that hypercar trio. One squeeze of the right pedal and that secret 'Ring lap time becomes irrelevant. Read all about the McLaren P1 performance here</p>
